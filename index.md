## Welcome to Summer school on "Transcription, Epigenetics and early Development" webpage (July 4th-15th, 2022)

**Organizers**: Prof. Sebastian Arnold (Dept. of Pharmacology) and Prof. Marc Timmers (Dept. of Urology/DKTK standort Freiburg)

**Venue**: Library of the Institute of Experimental and Clinical Pharmacology, Albertstrasse 25, Freiburg

**Registration**: http://www.sgbm.uni-freiburg.de/index.php?option=com_content&view=article&id=539&Itemid=397

**Description of content**: 
Regulation of gene expression and of chromatin function is pivotal for
the understanding of (early) development programs, cellular homeostasis and many disease
states. The transcription process is critically linked to the regulation of chromatin function.
Epigenetic mechanisms such as histone modifications can transmit active/inactive states of a
gene through cellular divisions, which are particularly relevant during early mammalian
development. The study of transcription, chromatin regulation and early development
received a great impetus through the availability of whole genome sequences, which sparked
development of many novel high-throughput sequencing technologies. Integration of
biochemistry, molecular biology, genomics, proteomics and cell biology now provides
unprecedented insight into transcription and chromatin regulation in health and disease.
This course will teach the crucial concepts of regulation of gene expression, with a focus on
the process of transcription at the molecular level, and also including concepts derived from
cellular, developmental and disease states. Epigenetics, chromatin and genome organization
will be taught, as well as state-of-the-art strategies and techniques in the field of gene
regulation and genome research, all with a reference to human disease and development.
The covered topics are: genome/gene organization, pol II transcription initiation/elongation,
chromatin remodeling, chromatin modifications, epigenetic inheritance, nuclear organization,
early vertebrate embryonic development, signals and pathways, cell lineage specification,
pluripotency, germ cells and genomic imprinting. Many techniques will be explained, including
classical assays used to investigate transcription, as well as high-throughput genomic
approaches and systems biology analyses. When you are only superficially interested in the
mechanisms of gene expression, epigenetics and development, this course is not suitable for
you.
